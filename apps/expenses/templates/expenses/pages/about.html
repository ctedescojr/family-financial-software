        About Family Finances
      </h1>
      <p class="text-lg mb-4">
        <strong>Family Finances</strong> is a smart and user-friendly web
        application designed to help families take control of their financial
        lives.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg mb-4">
        The platform enables you to track your
        <strong>fixed expenses</strong> and manage
        <strong>variable expenses</strong> from your shopping activities, all in
        one place.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg mb-4">
        One of the core features of Family Finances is the use of
        <strong>artificial intelligence</strong> to assist with shopping
        decisions. The system allows you to create shopping lists and suggests
        the most cost-effective places to buy, by calculating not only product
        prices but also <strong>travel distances</strong> and
        <strong>fuel costs</strong> using Google Maps integration.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg mb-4">
        You can even upload your receipts or invoices, and the system will
        automatically extract product information using OCR (Optical Character
        Recognition) and AI models, helping you keep your expenses up to date
        effortlessly.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg mb-4">
        With Family Finances, you spend less time worrying about money and more
        time enjoying what matters most.
      </p>
